# Container Image Synchronization
This project serves as a proof of concept for synchronizing images from public registries to a private GitHub registry.

## Public Registries
A public registry is a centralized repository where developers can upload and share Docker images with others. Examples of public registries include Docker Hub and Google Container Registry.

## Private Registries
A private registry, on the other hand, is a registry that is restricted to only specific users and is not publicly accessible. In this case, we will be using a private GitHub registry.

## Docker Images
Docker images are snapshots of a container, including all of its files and system libraries. They can be easily transported and run on any machine with Docker installed.

## GitHub Registry
GitHub Registry is a package management service that makes it easy to publish, discover, and download packages with GitHub. In this case, we will be using GitHub Registry to store our Docker images.

## Synchronization
The process of synchronizing images involves copying the images from the public registry to the private GitHub registry. This ensures that the images are backed up and can be easily retrieved in the future.
